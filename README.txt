This project folders consists of the below files:
Project2.py : main python script which implements the algorithm
input files : small.txt, medium.txt, large.txt
output files : Respective output files for the given sample input files
verifyGraph.py : Script to verify the output

Steps to perform:
1) Open command prompt and move to the project directory location.
2) Run the Project2.py file along with the input file name and output file name in which the output should be saved.
command: python3 Project2.py <input_file_name> <output_file_name>
3) Output path generated will be saved into the output file mentioned in the above command.
4) Execute the project for different sample inputs(small.txt, medium.txt, large.txt) and generate respective output files.
5) Now, verify the output by executing the verifyGraph.py script as follows:
command: python3 verifyGraph.py <input_file_name> <output_file_name>

6) If the path generated after running the project is valid, a prompt "Path is correct." will be displayed.
